# Bus Tracking GPS

Included original Ada Fruit GPS program, original GPRS HTTP POST program (from Pachube), and both programs combined and modified
which is the one that is actually loaded to the Arduino.
Just copy the combined program to the Arduino SDK and uploaded to the Arduino.
For GPS model and wiring visit https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-ultimate-gps/arduino-wiring.
The GPRS Shield is from SeeedStudio.
